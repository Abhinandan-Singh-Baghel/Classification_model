# Prototype-Based Classification README

## Introduction
This repository contains Python scripts for two prototype-based classification methods for the "Animals with Attributes" dataset. The methods are implemented in `convex.py` and `regress.py`. This README provides instructions on how to run the code and summarizes the key steps.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Data Preparation
- Download the dataset from the provided link and unzip it.
- Ensure the dataset is organized as described in the assignment.

### Step 2: Method 1 (Convex Combination)
- Run the `convex.py` script.

### Step 3: Method 2 (Linear Regression)
- Run the `regress.py` script.
- Experiment with different values of Î» to find the best value for the linear regression model.

### Step 4: Evaluation
- Both methods include evaluation steps to measure classification accuracy.
- The results will be printed to the console.

## Dependencies
- numpy
- scikit-learn (for linear regression)
